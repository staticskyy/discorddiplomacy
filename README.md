# OBJECTIVES
The objective of Diplomacy is to control 18 out of 34 nations by the end of a year. Alternatively, if 7 turns go by without a capture or the game reaches 35 turns, whoever controls the most territory wins.
As well, players can agree on a draw between all standing nations if desired.
## THE BOARD
There are three types of territories: Sea, Land, and Costal. 34 of the land and costal territories contain supply centers (marked by a black circle on the map). These allow you build more units in your home supply centers (and win the game).
Note: Three costal territories have multiple coastlines (Spain, Bulgaria, and St. Petersburg). Fleets are considered as stationed at one coast or another and cannot travel from one coast to the other in a single turn.
Note: GREY territories are neutral, and cannot be passed through.(edited)
Units
There are two types of units: Armies (represented by an (A) on the map) and Fleets (represented by an [F] on the map). Armies can travel into land or coastal territories, whereas Fleets can travel into coastal or sea territories. Fleets are important to help convoy units across water, support coastal battles, and create blockades.

# ORDERS
There are four basic orders in Diplomacy: HOLD, ATTACK/MOVE, SUPPORT, and CONVOY.

## HOLD
This is what a unit does if given no other orders. The unit will stay in its current territory. It is able to be SUPPORTed by other units, however. If a HOLDing unit is attacked and is defeated, it must either retreat or disband (to be discussed further down).

## ATTACK/MOVE
This moves a unit into an adjacent province. Units may only move one territory per turn. A unit may not move into a territory held by another unit unless it is SUPPORTED, and the support is higher than the defender's. If an attack is unsuccessful, the unit attacking does not move.

## SUPPORT
This is the most complex part of the game (so if you can follow this you're set you handsome devil).
Supporting a unit (yours or someone else's) increases the unit's power moving into another territory.  (AGAIN YOU CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE'S UNITS ) 
(think of it like this; each unit is equal to one power. if you move into a territory controlled by someone else with one unit and support it with one of yours, that's 2:1 and you kick them out)
In order to support a move, the supporting unit must be able to move into the territory that is being attacked.  If the supporting unit is attacked during the turn by some other unit, its support is cut. In effect, the support order becomes a hold order, as the unit must defend its province against the attack. The supporting unit remains where it was.(edited)
## CONVOY
Fleets are able to convoy armies across water using this order. A fleet must be in a Sea territory in order to do this.  Let us say, for instance, that in Fall 1901 England has the following position:
Army Yorkshire
Fleet North Sea
Fleet English Channel

A convoy order would be:

--England--
Army Yorkshire to Norway
Fleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway
Unless a unit were to defeat the fleet, The army would convoy across the coast.

#GAME PHASES
Gameplay begins in the year 1901, and there are two moves or Movement Phases per year, one in Spring, and one in Fall.
1.  Before the move, all orders have to be submitted to the DM (that's me!)
2. If a unit is defeated in battle, a Retreat phase occurs. Units defeated must either be retreated to an unoccupied adjacent space, or disbanded and removed from the game.
3. After the Fall move, but before the next year,  a tally is made of the total number of supply centers controlled by each player. A player controls a supply center if it has a unit (army or fleet) occupying the province with that supply center at the end of a year.
4. Each supply center can support one military unit, so players that have gained supply centers over the course of the year can build new units. New units may be created at any of the player's unoccupied home supply centers, but only at these centers, and at most one unit per center. For this reason, no more than 3 new units per player can ever be created at a time (except in the case of Russia, which has 4 home supply centers).(edited)
On the other hand, if a player has more units than supply centers at the end of the year, then it must disband units of its choice until it has equal numbers of units and supply centers.
Players may not choose to disband below the number of supply centers in their possession, for this would allow players to replace units in the field with new units back home instantaneously. For instance, a player who has more armies than necessary and wants a fleet in order to capture a far-away supply center cannot simply disband an army and build a new fleet on a home supply center.

# LAWS

This is just stuff about how our particular game is gonna play out.

Turns will have a 3 day planning period. Send your moves to me in a DM when you are 100% certain. (you may want to make changes based on changing alliances). In terms or formatting, you can do it however you want. Something like this is fine:

Army Moscow to Ukraine
Army Warsaw supports Army Moscow
Fleet North Sea convoys Army Yorkshire to Norway


Or for something more concise

A Mos Ukr
A War S A Mos
F Nth C A Yrk Nor

As long as it's clear.


Obviously, negotiation and diplomacy is strongly encouraged, whether that be in public or private.
